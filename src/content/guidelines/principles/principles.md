**At IBM, we define design as the intent behind an outcome. Great experiences deliver meaningful outcomes to your user. They reach both head and heart. To design for great user experiences, you must understand how they are put together and why they can touch people at a deeper level.**

## Be essential

Every element in an experience should have a purpose. Leaving complexity behind allows you to design with restraint by emphasizing the essential and stripping away the distracting. Provide all the necessary information in a sleek and elegant way, so we can be distinct, clear, and concise with our users.

## Be inclusive

Good design should work for everyone. We need not to focus only on the average person, with regular needs and expectations. Keep in mind that the people using your products will be extremely diverse. User diversity covers variation in capabilities, needs, and aspirations. Empathize with a full spectrum of potential users instead of designing around a checklist.

## Be consistent

Consistency is not exact replication. Rather, it's a harmonious uniformity, instilling predictability and stability. A successful design should leave our users feeling like, “Yes, that makes sense.” Being consistent gives users the power to anticipate what will happen next. And when users encounter something that is expected, it creates a sense of comfort and trust. Usability is greatly improved when an experience acts and feels the same throughout.

## Be humanistic

More than being user-centered, we must be human-centered. Our designs are conceived from a deep understanding of the people behind the product and with the desire to help individuals accomplish their goals. Part of being humanistic is embracing empathy. Empathy is the ability to understand and share another personʼs perspective, feelings, and challenges. Go out of your way to identify with your user's needs.

## Be delightful

Enhances usability and delight by embracing the spirit of “just enough design”. Engaging users with inspiration and curiosity by designing experiences to encourage critical thinking and creative confidence. Be mindful of usersʼ needs by providing them with the right tools at the right time. Make an offering so effective that it doesn't simply read as a software or a product but as something useful in that person's life.
